# Tenet: Amazing Algorithms For Toppling Titanic Problems Efficiently 

![HomeImage](https://ourculturemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tenet-10-696x392.jpeg)

**All I have for you is gesture, in combination with a word: Tenet. Use it carfeully. It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones too.**

**Ave** or more classically - Welcome to my algorithms repository prudently perplexed protagonist! Here, I've attempted to eloquently and explicitly elucidate algorithmic esoterica, specifically the concepts and problems tackled in [CSE 202 - Algorithm Design and Analysis](https://algorithms.eng.ucsd.edu/cse202). 

At a high-level the problems and solutions provided here cover the following algorithmic approaches: *Divide and Conquer, Dynammic Programming, Greedy, Network Flow, and Approximation Algorithms*. For transparency, I've included not only my solutions (along with accompanying scores/grades), but also the course-provided solutions. I strongly recommend trying the problems first before looking at the solutions. 

I hope that this proves to be an invaluable resource that is able to guide you in your quest to algorithm mastery.  If any questions arise or a desire for other resources (e.g., course/discussion notes, exams) feel free to reach out. Otherwise I wish you good fortune in the problems to come, and of course may the algorithms be ever in your favor!

Finally, if you found this repository to be helpful in anyway I humbly request you consider donating to the JVT caffeine fund. As a lifelong student, coffee is my signature sustaining staple, a magical potion concocted to provide power and inspiration to conquer even the most daunting deadlines. Until we meet again in another repository my fellow algorithm master.
